<p>A bit about myself:</p>

<p> Hi, I’m Marc and I thought I would tell you a little bit about myself … I was born in Stockport in 1985, moved to Liverpool in 98/99, 
    moved away from Liverpool around 02/03 and lived around the country for a few years before moving back to Liverpool around 10/11 … 
    I met my Partner, Emma and moved to a little-known place called Towcester in Northamptonshire around 2012. 
    We later decided to move back up North a few years ago and we now currently live just on the border of the Peak District National park with our dog, Albus!

<p>Hobbies:</p>

<p>
    I am big into technology and try to keep up with the latest tech as much as I can! My house is filled with everything from smart bulbs/LED’s to sockets that operate my fish tank lights, 
    to separate Wi-Fi hubs on each floor of my house with full ethernet connectivity for the devices I want a wired connection.
    <br>
    <br>
    I play Xbox, Nintendo and PC games with a group of friends whenever I need to relax at home and disconnect from the outside world. 
    I also play retro consoles from back when I was a child.
    <br>
    <br>
    I do a lot of outdoor pursuits too, but not quite as much as I did when I was younger … Still a varied amount though! From kayaking and bodyboarding/surfing to wild camping
     and hiking.
    <br>
