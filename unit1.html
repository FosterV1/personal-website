        Q 1.1: Describing the purpose of IT in modern business
        <br>
        <br>

        A 1.1:
        What is the purpose of IT in modern businesses? I would say for the vast majority of businesses It is fundamental to how they compete with other companies and grow as a company too.  Without IT in businesses today we would not have things like stock control databases, online shopping and contactless payments! 
        <br>

        Q 1.2: Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully – what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills?
        <br>
        <br>

        A 1.2:
        The methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully in today’s world are readily available and mostly free to use! From the Kanban inspired Trello to the online database Wikipedia! It is all at your fingertips! You will need skills such as time management and problem solving, but most of all you will need determination and focus! Especially if you are working alone.

        Q 1.3: Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your trello board.
        <br>
        <br>
        
        A 1.3:
        To enable myself to plan and carry out the making of my website I’m going to use <a href="https://trello.com/b/AJBhikCA/coursework" target=_blank>Trello</a> so that I can stay on top of what I need to do and give myself clear goals.

        Q 1.4: Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why?
        <br>
        <br>

        A 1.4:
        There are multiple reasons why digital projects can fail but I find there are a few main one’s that have the highest impact; from infrastructure breakdowns like the internet going down to hardware failures such as you HDD breaking and losing all your data! (Keep backups people!) but people can also be the main reason too! Poor leadership, communication and/or not noticing when things need to be addressed can cause the project to come to a grinding halt or even an abrupt end. Some things you just cannot control, but those things you can control need a lot of attention and communication to make sure everybody is on the same page with the project and ensure a smooth pathway to completion.

        Q 1.5: Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?
        <br>
        <br>

        A 1.5:
        I would go about identifying the technology I needed to complete the job by looking at what skills gaps I have and if there is any software/piece of physical tech that could help fill that gap. I would look at possibly doing any necessary training that would need to be done to help complete the job. Make sure I have the right support structures in place for if something goes wrong. And most importantly have a back-up plan!

        Q1.6: Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. – How has trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control
        <br>
        <br>

        A 1.6:
        Trello has really helped me structure my project and ensure I am keeping to my schedule and not missing any important steps. It also helps me document each individual part of the process. Having colour coded tabs means I can see what cards coincide with which part of the project too.
        Slack has been incredibly helpful with keeping up with other team members and sharing ideas.
        Zoom has been important so that we can gain advice and assistance from tutors or the group.
        Google Hangouts has been great for 1 to 1’s when you need that little bit of extra support and guidance.
        <br>

        Q 1.7: Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects?
        <br>
        <br>

        A 1.7:
        The way GDPR impacts digital projects is as follows:
        <br>
        <br>
        1) Lawful, fair and transparent processing:
            You must always process data in a lawful manner. Only use data for legitimate reasons and be completely transparent in how you will use the data you collect.
        <br>
        <br>
            2) Limitation of purpose, data and storage:
            You must limit the use of data and collect only which you see as necessary to fulfil your requirement that is allowed by law. Forbid sharing of data without stating that you are going to do so in the first place and make sure data is deleted upon completion of the task in which it was collected for.
        <br>
        <br>
            3)Data subject rights:
        The subjects in which the data has been collected from know their rights. Know they have the right to complain, correct and ask for deletion or transfer of their data.
        <br>
        <br>
        4) consent:
        You must always get consent for any data you collect from the subject and if the subject is below the age of 16 that you have the consent of a relevant parent/guardian.
        <br>
        <br>
        5)Personal data breaches:
        You must keep a register of all personal data breaches based on severity, the regulator and the subject of the data breach should be notified within 72 hours.
        <br>
        <br>
        6)Privacy by design:
        You should incorporate organisational and technical mechanisms to protect user data that has been collected. This should be ensured by default.
        <br>
        <br>
        7)Data protection Impact assessment:
        Data protection impact assessments should be conducted when you start a new project, initiate a change or make a or product.
        <br>
        <br>
        8) Data transfers:
        You must always ensure the protection of data even when transferring to a third party. As the controller of the data you are responsible for its security.
        <br>
        <br>
        9)Data protection officer:
        Where possible and as good practice you should always assign a data protection officer who would be responsible for advising the company about compliance with EU GDPR requirements etc
        <br>
        <br>
        10)Awareness and training:
        You must ensure that you promote awareness within your company of GDPR requirements etc.
        <br>

        Outcome 2: Review and adapt the ongoing use of IT tools and systems to make sure that activities are successful

        Now you have setup your blog, it’s time to get into the detail. You now need to critically review your website.

        To the bottom of your website add a review section that contains the following information.
        <br>
        <br>
        _____________________________________________________________
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Q 2.1: Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Codepen, Trello
        <br>
        <br>
        A 2.1:
        At the moment I’m very happy with the tools I’ve been using to make my website. I’ve had to change my approach when it comes to the order I put things into my website as I learn more CSS, but it hasn’t caused any major problems.
        <br>
        <br>

        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Q 2.2: Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Codepen, Trello
        <br>
        <br>
        A 2.2: The tools I chose to use were mainly visual Studio Code and Trello. Both were perfect for the task of making a website. Studio code was appropriate because without it I would not be able to create my webpage. It enabled me to use three different languages, HTML, CSS and JavaScript on my website together. Trello helped me organise my time and tasks using the Kanban method. It enabled me to make notes of idea that I could come back to later if I could.
        <br>

        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Q 2.3: Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?
        <br>
        <br>
        A 2.3: Am I happy with my website? I am happy with the progress I have made on the website so far … I feel like I can improve the site so much more, add some better content and improve the overall layout and usability. There are projects underway to improve various aspects of my site like animations. I am updating my site constantly as I come across more things that I think would add to my site.
        <br>
        <br>

        <br>
        Q 2.4: Describe further improvements you can make to your project
        <br>
        <br>
        A 2.4: I have got a few improvements I would like to make if time were not a factor: I would like to improve the flow of the website. I would like to add animation to various parts of my website. In the gallery on my website I would like to add a comment box for pictures and a “like” button possibly. I would like to add a better way for navigation between pages. Make my website fun as well as informative. improve background/banner graphic.

        Q 2.5: Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose
        <br>
        <br>
        A 2.5: Once I had made sure that I had completed everything needed for the deadline, I implemented changes on my website such as layout changes and adding content, Incorporated flexbox and animations , I have added new pages to show off content in different ways ,Improved the background/banner and I  have added my project from an earlier team exercise (Lost in Space game) to my website.
        <br>

        <br>  
        Q 3.1: Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?
        <br>
        <br>
        A 3.1: I realised that by making shortcuts for keys on my keyboard I could improve efficiency whilst using Visual Studio code and maybe I can transfer that too other tools. Trello was a great help in keeping track of the various tasks needing completing in the building of my website, but I feel that it works better when you have a team to divide the workload with. It seems quite overwhelming when you look at your Trello board and you know every card is for you to do yourself. Overall, I think building a website in a team is the best option as it shares the work. you can utilise each other’s stronger skills, you can get more ideas/feedback and most of all, you can get help if you need it but, as the content of this website was more personal in nature it needed to be done as an individual.
        I could of spent less time fixing bugs at the start, or adding the “frills” that I wanted and just concentrated on the core content and focused on those extras more in my own time.

        Q 3.2: Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency
        <br>
        <br>
        A 3.2:
        Ways I could improve productivity and efficiency are to concentrate on tasks in a more broken down way – break down tasks into smaller tasks if possible. Spend less time on tasks you are stuck on and come back to it with a fresh mind a later time. You could do this by taking more short breaks.
        <br> 
        <br>

        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Q 3.3: Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?
        <br>
        <br>
        A 3.3: What would I do differently next time? Use my time more evenly between website coursework and website design, this is because I concentrated more on the part I enjoyed most (Design) and neglected the. Take more small breaks rather than sitting and stewing on an issue, step away from the screen for a few minutes and come back with a fresh mind and possibly outcome. Ask for more feedback from colleagues/peers and use that better to improve my learning and application of my skills. I would use more JavaScript within my website to expand on the overall feel of the website and not have the website seem so simplistic. This would show off more of my skills too.

        Q 3.4: Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions
        <br>
        <br>
        A 3.4: I would go about testing each individual element and making sure they correspond with my initial design outline, or any improvements I implemented. Checking spellings, grammar, punctuation. I would use a debugging extension to double check my code. I would ask other people to look and review my code or webpage at various different stages in the build process. I would test individual elements on there own to break down any issues that arise. I would also check accessibility issues and implement a fix/improvement where possible.
