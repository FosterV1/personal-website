    Q 1.1: Describing the content and layout for each page
    <br>
    <br>
    A 1.1: Home page: My home page is themed around early PC’s of my childhood and the Matrix style. It has some pictures of myself in various locations showing what I’m about. I have a nav bar below that so people can access other pages of my website. Below the nav bar I have a bio about myself to give the reader a bit more info about just who I am and what I enjoy.
    Unit 1/2 pages: same styling at the home page, but in between various parts of the text we have pictures relevant to the content of the page.
    Interesting things page: This has the same structure, layout and theme as the previous pages but, it will be used to display things I find interesting on. Maybe links to other pages, memes or a blog.
    Gallery page: This has the same structure, layout and theme as the previous pages but, this will be where I upload pictures that I’ve taken that I think should be shared.

    Q 1.2:	Plan and create your website
    <br>
    <br>
    A 1.2: I have planned my website using a <a href="https://trello.com/b/AJBhikCA/coursework" target=_blank>Trello board</a>, so I can see my tasks individually as I go and keep track of them. I will be using Visual Studio Code to make the various pages for my website.

    Q 1.3:	Selecting and using web site features and structure
    <br>
    <br>
    A 1.3: I had a think about what features I like on various other websites and what I could achieve in the time I had and with the skills I have learned so far … I decided to keep a simplistic look to my site as I wanted it to feel very 1980’s but with a modern touch. I decided I would add a music player to the bottom of my bio for instance for that modern touch.

    Q 1.4:	Selecting and using styles to keep your site consistent
    <br>
    <br>
    A 1.4: I played around with a few ideas for my website, but in the end I’ve selected a very 1980’s looking computer style and I have used this throughout: I made a template that I can use when adding new pages to make adding anything new easier.

    <br>
    Q 1.5: Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites
    <br>
    <br>
    A 1.5: Some of the constraints of copyright include what I can put on my website, but it also in turn protects and content that I put on my site that is original to me. constraints effecting websites can be what the end user is viewing your site on i.e. how it looks on a PC to how it looks on a phone.

    Q 1.6: Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them
    <br>
    <br>
    A 1.6: Issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages range from navigation problems to filling out forms and not being able to see relevant images. We can overcome these problems by making sure our webpage is navigable by using just the keyboard for instance, or adding text to images so that people who use screen readers can “see” the images too by having the description read out tot them.

    Q 1.7: Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites
    <br>
    <br>
    A 1.7: Appropriate file types for websites could be PNG, BMP, GIF, JPG and TIF for images. The choice of which of these you use can be anything from quality to size constraints on the webpage. TIF for instance is of the highest quality and maybe a lower quality file type could be used, such as JPG.
